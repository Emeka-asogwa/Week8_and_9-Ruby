# RUBY

`irb` is Ruby's command line REPL (read-eval-print-loop) much like how `node` is JavaScript's.

To run your ruby file saved with extension `.rb`, use :

```
ruby file.rb
```

## Looping through an array: Example

```ruby
array = ['Hello', 'you', 'please', 'come']
array.each { |word| puts word }

Hello
you
please
come
```

## In ruby

- Capitalized words can be used to define a constant
- A constant can refer to a Module, a Class or simple data like Floats and Strings
- Namespacing is used heavily to limit the exposure of constants defined in the global namespace
- The `::` Syntax is used to access constants (Modules, Classes, etc)
- It is convention to only capitalize the first letter when defining Class and Module constants like Apple
- It is convention to capitalize and underscore the entire name when defining value constants like FOUNDED_BY

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Ruby

Ruby is an object-oriented-programming language (OOP) that uses classes as blueprints for objects.

Some terminologies in OOP

- **Encapsulation**
  This is hiding pieces of functionality and making it unavailable to the rest of the code base, in this way, data can be protected from being manipulated or changed without a conscious intention.

  Just like many other OO languages, ruby creates objects, and expose interfaces (i.e., methods) to interact with those objects.

- **Polymorphism** <br>
  **Poly** stands for "many" and **morph** stands for "forms". This is the ability for different types of data to respond to a common interface.
