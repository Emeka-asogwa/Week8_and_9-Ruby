# RUBY

`irb` is Ruby's command line REPL (read-eval-print-loop) much like how `node` is JavaScript's.

To run your ruby file saved with extension `.rb`, use :

```
ruby file.rb
```

## Looping through an array: Example

```
array = ['Hello', 'you', 'please', 'come']
array.each { |word| puts word }

Hello
you
please
come
```
